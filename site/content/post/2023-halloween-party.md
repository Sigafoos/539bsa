T﻿he Troop 539 Halloween party was a blast. There was a piñata and so of the kids got to hit it and make the candy fall out but it was hard and we eventully just knocked it over and a kid stepped on it and then one of the adults ripped it and through the candy every where all of the kids dived for it.

W﻿e also played musicale chairs and everybody loved that. We also had a donut eating contes and that was really fun, if you donut know what that is it is where there is a donut on a string and you have to eat it as fast as you can without the use of your hands.
