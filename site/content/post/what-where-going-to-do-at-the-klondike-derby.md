At the end of January we will be at the Polaris District [Klondike Derby](https://www.wnyscouting.org/document/po-klondike-guide-2023/210445). We will being 9 events including 2 person saw and slap shot challenge.

There will be snow and ice on the ground and we are sleeping in a hammock lean-to and Tents. Last year my patrol was cub scouts and we couldn't light the fire in the fire lighting challenge but this year we are hoping to start the fire and we have learned a lot more so it should be easy.
