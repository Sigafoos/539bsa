This year Troop 539 went to the Adirondacks(ADKS). The first night everyone got there Paul, Dylan, Isaiah, and Dan slept on couches; Brandon slept in a chair; Ty, Simon, Ryon, and Emmet slept on the floor; Neil slept on a table and the adults got the beds. 

Day 1 in the morning we got up had breakfast then went snowshoeing in the High Peaks region. The Duckies went to Avalanche Pass about 10 miles and the Biscuits went up Mount Colden about 7 miles but it is a harder trail so it would take longer to go there and back to ADk lodge. Then everyone went back to the cabin and had dinner which was meatball bombers, then went to bed.

Day 2 in the morning we had breakfast then went to the ski jumps and went to the top of the high ski ump. Some went outside the tower and onto the roof looking down the jump while some of us stayed inside the tower. Then we went to Mount Van Hoevenberg and saw not 1 but 2 bobsleds go by us and got videos and pictures.

Then, we went to Lake Placid. First, everyone got parked which was challenging, then half of us had ice cream at Emma's ( I don't know what the other half of the group did.)  My half of the group went to a store that had everything in there for 50% Off! We also went to a popcorn store, a USA hockey store, a book store, walked out on to Mirror lake, went to multiple clothing stores, and also saw the 1932 and the 1980 (Miracle on Ice) hockey rink. Then, everyone met up at Maine Street Pizza. Then we ice skated at the speed skating rink. We went back to the cabin and watched *The Hunt for Red October*. 

Day 3 everyone had breakfast and everyone went home.
